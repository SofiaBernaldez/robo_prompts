I didn't know that we had to paste our code onto our github but I do have my codes in my design journal. I'M SO SORRY MS. TERKPER PLEASE SPARE ME: 
But anyway's here's my code for day 8: 
print("Wazzupp!! Welcome to your every day every week affirmation OR insult generator!")
print()
name= input("What is your name?")
print()
if name == "Mr. Jak" or name== "mr. jak":
  day = input("What is thy day of thy week?")
  if day == "monday" or day == "Monday":
    print("It is going to be a bald Monday", name)
    if day == "tuesday" or day == "Tuesday": 
      print("You bring the baldness to everyone's day", name, "!")
    if day == "wednesday" or day == "Wednesday":
        print("I was looking at the mirror today, oh wait! It's just your bald head LOLZIES")
    if day == "thursday" or day == "thursday":
      print("You should win #3 most bald award, #3 since there are many bald people balder than YOU", name, "Which is lowkey kinda crazy, but you're still bald!")
      if day == "friday" or day == "Friday":
        print(name, "It's bald Friday!!!")
